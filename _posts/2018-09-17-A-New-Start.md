  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Previous to this lesson, I had made an entire github blog and made blogs for the past year, adding features such as videos, tables, font styles and gradients. I had used a variety of sites, such as JS Bin and W3 Schools to help me test out code and choose appropriate colours so that my blog would look appropriate and pleasurable to the eye. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My aim for this lesson was to delete my former repository and then establish a new one which was brought up to at least the same standard as my previous blog, so that over the course of the year I can add more features to it. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I did not reach my target as I have not yet added features such as a video however, I have brought everything up to the same standard as it was before using my prior knowledge. By the end of the week, however, I hope to have added a video using the W3schools guide online. </td>

    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>This week, I had to persevere a substantial amount. Firstly, persevering was used when I accidentally deleted my '_posts' option from my Github Code, and therefore couldn’t publish any of my blogs. I persevered by looking at different sites as to why this might have happened, such as our school’s Github FAQ page and I also asked other people in my class if they may have known why. I came across the answer that it may have been because I deleted my ‘Hello World’ Blog Post, and therefore the entire folder, and therefore  I couldn't publish anything. I followed up my conclusion by seeing Mr Keen and asking him for some help on what I had done wrong. This allowed me to build a new folder and publish this blog.
