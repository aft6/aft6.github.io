  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I did reach my target this week as I managed to finish this project along with my pair and then progress onto getting ready to set up my LED lights, however, I never got to use them. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td>The five main learning techniques at Challoner's- persevering, questioning, independence, reflecting and engagement.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>This week Persevering was used greatly- having to  figure out why my Fuze Box wouldn't set up puzzled me. In the end I figured it was a loose plug after checking all connections were in correctly and that the Boz was switched on. In the future I need to check the connection cables and plugs so that I don’t waste time at the beginning of a lesson. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Questioning was used when my Fuze Box wouldn’t set up. I had to question myself why my Fuze Box hadn’t set up in previous weeks and therefore what I was likely to encounter before I could fix my issue. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Independence wasn’t used as we workee in pairs; this allowed us to use each others’ help and progress much further. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected on previous lessons and the code that I had used so that I could add them to my current code to further enhance my work. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was engaged as I was consistently helping my teammate to add more code and make our progress as big as we could so that we could meet our aim for the day.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td>During the lesson, I could have checked everything was connected properly as this wasted a substantial amount of my time at the beginning of the lesson. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td>Next lesson, I am going to ensure that all of my cables and plugs are connected properly so that time is not wasted and I can learn and make as much progress as possible. </td>
  </tr>
