PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

I Would like to be a Pianist and Music teacher so that I can help many bears all over the county so that they can reach their full potential when it comes to extra curricular activities such as Music. Also, I have a strong passion for Music and especially the Piano and I would love to continue my passion as my career to fufill my own ambitions as well as help others' to achieve theirs! I have a careful ear when listening to music and am experienced in quartet and orchaestral settings.

PERSONAL STATEMENT

I am a hard working and ethical bear who recently graduated with a 2:1 masters degree along with honors from the University of Oxford in the field of music, specialising in Percusssion for my last year. I am looking to assume a role as Piano teacher to bears from across Torquay and the suburbs. My career goal is to assume the role of pianist in a city orchaestra and I believe that my previous experience during my placement year at the Berliner Philharmonika will aid me in my path to reach my full potential.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KEY SKILLS

I have a strong desire to perform all pieces of music to the best of my ability and this has allowed me to develop a goal- orientated mindset, shown whilst I learnt fluent German during my placement year. I am also skilled in the art of composition of music and can listen to musical pieces well, providing constructive criticism to all students. I am a competent musician and have developed strong communication skills, enabling me to interact with other members of an orchaestra or students that I teach.
