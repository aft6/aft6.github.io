  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>In the previous lesson, with my pair, I had set up a Fuze Computer and performed some very basic coding following an instruction book. I was familiar with how to plug the machine in and where to go to find the coding page. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>The overall aim for this lesson was to continue progressing along the booklet learning new skills and to develop a wider understanding of simple programming that we could undertake. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I reached my target as I finished the first task in the booklet, however, after we finished this, our Fuze Computer, which was labelled 'repair,' switched off and a message on the monitor said that it was ‘killing the programme.’ We tried a different fuze box and lots of different monitors but none worked, so in the end we had to go in another group, where progress was much slower. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td>The five main learning techniques at Challoner's- persevering, questioning, independence, reflecting and engagement.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Throughout the lesson, persevering was used greatly when trying to make our Fuze Box work on the different monitors. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Questioning wasn’t greatly used in this lesson. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>As this lesson was done in pairs, independence wasn’t used as we tried to make the most of the teamwork opportunities to progress as quickly and methodically as we could. Despite this, my pair came later than me so I had managed to already plug in all the cables to the Fuze Box and make it start up. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Reflecting was used as we had to reflect on what we learnt last week and how we could use that prior knowledge to progress through the booklet at a quicker speed. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Engagement was used consistently, from following the instructions given by the booklet to attempting to fix our broken Fuze Box. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td>In my learning, I could have greatly improved it by using sources available to me sooner. When I forgot where to plug in one of the cables, I didn’t look into my booklet for quite a while which wasted a lot of productive time, despite my partner coming later. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td>When working with a Fuze Box in the future, I need to use all sources available to me such as the internet, the booklet and peer advice which may be useful to me. </td>
