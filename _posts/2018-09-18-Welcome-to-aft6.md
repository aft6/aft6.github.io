Welcome to aft6- the home of my blog. Although you may not have heard of me, I am posting blogs daily with interesting facts for you to learn. Soon, my blog will be a signature name (hopefully)! Throughout the course of this year, I will be posting a weekly blog of what I have done in my Computer Science lesson. Also in this blog I will entail both gruesome and interesting facts about history, geography, maths, science and almost any subject daily but also pieces that I have written for my school's (DCGS’s) website. These will appear regularly on my main stream and I hope you enjoy these pieces. Facts will mention a subject’s name and website pieces will have 'DCGS Website’ attached in the title. Any other pieces are blogs. Below, you can see my email address link, however I have taken away my code link so that my facts remain hidden randomly within my README.md till published. Please email me any suggestions for improvements to my blog or facts that I can include.
