Welcome to aft6- the home of my blog. 

Although you may not have heard of me, I am posting blogs daily with interesting facts for you to learn. Throughout the course of this year, I will be posting a weekly blog of what I have done in my Computer Science lesson. Also in this blog I will entail both gruesome and interesting facts about different school subjects regularly, which will clearly be headed '{subject name} fact.'

To top all this, this blog stream will contain pieces that I have written for the school's website. These will be entitled 'SJT {name of topic}.'

These will appear regularly on my main stream and I hope you enjoy all of these pieces. 

Below, you can see my email address link, however I have privatised my codelink so that my facts remain hidden randomly within my README.md, where I am planning on storing them until they are published. Please email me any suggestions for improvements to my blog or for facts that you wish me to include. Please note that all post, except for this one, are ordered in terms of date, with the oldest at the bottom of this page.
