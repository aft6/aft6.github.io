    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Knowing all of the skills needed to create a countdown for a rocket launch which was what we had to make as part of our assessment. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>The aim for this lesson was to create a Fuze project spread over two screens which counted down the launch of a rocket. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I did reach my target as within the lesson, me and my pair, Thomas, managed to create this and start the extension tasks including changing the number of seconds the instructions told the programme to 'wait' for. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td>The five main learning techniques at Challoner's- persevering, questioning, independence, reflecting and engagement.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Throughout the course of the lesson, persevering was used greatly, such as when our text would not go to the middle of the page. We persevered, trying many different possible instructions, such as 'middle,’ ‘centre’ and ‘top’ to </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Questioning was used at the start of the lesson, whilst setting up. I questioned as to how I could set up the structure of my code but this was answered by my booklet which we were provided with. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Independence wasn’t used as we worked in pairs, helping each other and doing half of the jobs at a time. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Reflecting wasn’t used during this lesson very much as we have never worked using Fuze before but prior knowledge from Github was reflected on by both me and my partner so that we could code the basic parts on Fuze that we were meant to. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was engaged as me and my pair were constantly working on what the booklet told us to and were completing all of the stages quickly and efficiently compared to other groups. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td>In my learning, I could have paid more attention to what Mr Keen said at the beginning as me and my pair didn’t manage to switch on our Fuze Computer very quickly because we didn’t listen to the instruction that we switch it on after plugging everything in. . </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td>In the future, I need to heed any previous tips on how I can complete my work both more quickly and efficiently so that I can progress further into my work. </td>
