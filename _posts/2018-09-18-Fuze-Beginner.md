  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Prior to this lesson, I had no experience using this software, however, I had used other software sites, such as Github and JS Bin, which require a significant amount of coding. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My aim for this lesson was to set up our fuze beginner program onto our monitors with a partner and then follow a handbook to set up basic patterns for the computer to follow, such as repeatedly pasting our name every few seconds. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I reached my target this lesson as I managed to create a simple group programming instructions for the computer to follow with my pair.  </td>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td>The five main learning techniques at Challoner's- persevering, questioning, independence, reflecting and engagement.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Throughout the lesson, persevering was a key skill which I had to use. This was mainly with switching my Fuze Computer on. I had connected some wrong wires into my computer and therefore both my mouse and keyboard weren’t working. Me and my pair persevered by consulting our booklet on how to setup the layout and which plugs to connect into which ports, which helped us continue with the lesson’s work greatly. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Questioning was used at the start of the lesson, whilst setting up. I questioned as to how I could set up the structure of my code but this was answered by my booklet which we were provided with. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>As we worked in pairs for this lesson, independence wasn’t a key factor, however, I independently thought of a way for me to be able to access the code next lesson without having to start from scratch, which was in the form of taking a photo on main elements of my code which I entered.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Reflecting wasn’t used during this lesson very much as we have never worked using Fuze before but prior knowledge from Github was reflected on by both me and my partner so that we could code the basic parts on Fuze that we were meant to. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was engaged as me and my pair were constantly working on what the booklet told us to and were completing all of the stages quickly and efficiently compared to other groups. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td>In my learning, I could have paid more attention to what Mr Keen said at the beginning as me and my pair didn’t manage to switch on our Fuze Computer very quickly because we didn’t listen to the instruction that we switch it on after plugging everything in. . </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td>In the future, I need to heed any previous tips on how I can complete my work both more quickly and efficiently so that I can progress further into my work. </td>
