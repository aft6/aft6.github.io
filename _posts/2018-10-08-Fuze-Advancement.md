  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td> Having previously completed an assessment on Fuze and had the previous half term spent learning how to code using a Fuze Box. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To continue in our booklet and successfully continue or compleet a project. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, as I finished project 1.3 in the fuze book with my pair. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td>The five main learning techniques at Challoner's- persevering, questioning, independence, reflecting and engagement.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>In the lesson, persevering was used greatly when some of my code did not work on my Fuze Box. I had to try different combinations of the code that I had written after carefully checking that I had not made any editors within the code itself. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Questioning was used when I questioned myself what code I could change to ensure that it worked properly. Also, there were minor edits such as capital letters which caused cascade errors, so identifying them through questioning was key. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Independence wasnâ€™t used in the lesson as I worked in a pair. We collaborated and communicated well, allowing us to complete a good amount of tasks which we were meant to. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Reflecting was used greatly as we had to continuously look back at what we had done previous weeks to remind us and stimulate ourselves so that we could further advance and enhance our work within the lesson. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Engagement was absolutely key in this lesson. To finish the task which we were doing, we had to be 100% engaged and completely focused throughout the lesson so that we could finish the piece in time. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td>I could have set the Fuze Box up more quickly. Between every lesson I always forget how to set it up and spend five minutes wasting time- such as forgetting to switch on the Fuze Box. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td>I need to remember how to set up the Fuze Box and remember it; I need to remember the essentials of setting it up, like switching on the power socket. </td>
  </tr>
