  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Knowing all of the skills needed to create a countdown for a rocket launch which was what we had to make as part of our assessment. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>The aim for this lesson was to create a Fuze project spread over two screens which counted down the launch of a rocket. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I did reach my target as within the lesson, me and my pair, Thomas, managed to create this and start the extension tasks including changing the number of seconds the instructions told the programme to 'wait' for. </td>
  </tr>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td>The five main learning techniques at Challoner's- persevering, questioning, independence, reflecting and engagement.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Throughout the course of the lesson, persevering was used greatly, such as when our text would not go to the middle of the page. We persevered, trying many different possible instructions, such as 'middle,’ ‘centre’ and ‘top’ to get the text in the centre of the page. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Questioning was used when I was attempting to figure out tricky steps in the boolet which we had not yet covered, such as how to make a new screen. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Independence wasn’t used as we worked in pairs, helping each other and doing half of the jobs at a time. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Reflecting was used greatly in this lesson as we had to reflect on what we learnt in previous lessons to complete this assessment within the lesson’s permitted time. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was engaged as me and my pair were constantly figuring out something new or frantically attempting to correct some code that we had just figured out. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td>In my learning, I could have paid more interesting setting it up as I thought that I knew how to and so didn’t bother to pay attention or be engaged with that. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td>Next time, I need to engage with every aspect of the lesson so that I can learn the most from Computing whenever possible. </td>
  </tr>
