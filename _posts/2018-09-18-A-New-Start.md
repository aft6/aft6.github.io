  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Previous to this lesson, I had made an entire github blog and made blogs for the past year, adding features such as videos, tables, font styles and gradients. I had used a variety of sites, such as JS Bin and W3 Schools to help me test out code and choose appropriate colours so that my blog would look appropriate and pleasurable to the eye. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My aim for this lesson was to delete my former repository and then establish a new one which was brought up to at least the same standard as my previous blog, so that over the course of the year I can add more features to it. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I did not reach my target as I have not yet added features such as a video however, I have brought everything up to the same standard as it was before using my prior knowledge. By the end of the week, however, I hope to have added a video using the W3schools guide online. </td>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td>The five main learning techniques at Challoner's- persevering, questioning, independence, reflecting and engagement.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>This week, I had to persevere a substantial amount. Firstly, persevering was used when I accidentally deleted my '_posts’ option from my Github Code, and therefore couldn’t publish any of my blogs. I persevered by looking at different sites as to why this might have happened, such as our school’s Github FAQ page and I also asked other people in my class if they may have known why. I came across the answer that it may have been because I deleted my ‘Hello World’ Blog Post, and therefore the entire folder, and therefore  I couldn't publish anything. I followed up my conclusion by seeing Mr Keen and asking him for some help on what I had done wrong. This allowed me to build a new folder and publish this blog. 


Also, whilst adding decoration to my blog, I  accidentally changed the url link of my avatar which caused my blog to break. Later on I had to go back and find out what I had done wrong. I had to scrutinise my code and also compared it to others’ and found out that my link didn’t end correctly as it ended with .pngh which I may have accidentally added after pasting. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned a large amount in Computer Science this week. Firstly, since we hadn’t created a repository for nearly a year, I questioned myself about where I could access information to help me set up my new repository. After finding help on the Github Learning Blog Page, I managed to set one up effectively and quickly. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I was independent throughout the lesson as I managed to set up my github repository and publish a blog by myself during the lesson without help from anyone else. Also, I managed to decorate my blog professionally using style guides and W3 Schools as recommended to us. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Throughout the whole lesson, reflecting was a key skill that I used so that I could replicate the basic features of my blog that I added to my repository the previous year. As well as this, when I added extra features for homework, I reflected on both what I did the previous year and in the lesson so that I could continue my work. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was engaged throughout the lesson as I listened to all of the advice that Mr Keen gave us on what websites to look at to learn how we can add different pieces of decoration and style to our blog. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td>During the lesson, I could have produced a more fruitful blog by not wasting time. Just one example of this is when I wanted to change the url link. I tried changing some parts of my github page, such as the username and repository name, however this just broke my blog. I then fixed it, however, broke it again repeatedly trying to complete the same task as before. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td>In the future, when something doesn’t work, I need to tackle it in a different way from attempting it and then continuing to do the same thing over and over again if it doesn’t work the first time. Next time, I will tackle each part of my blog in a more innovative and creative approach so that I can be more informed about what steps I take to improve my blog. </td>
