    <td>The five main learning techniques at Challoner's- persevering, questioning, independence, reflecting and engagement.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Persevering was used when I had to figure out where the wires went into the Breadbox so that I could make my lights work. As the pictures weren’t clear, a lot of determination went into determining the wires’ positions. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Questioning was used when my wiring would not work the first time. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Independence wasn't used in the lesson as we collaborated in pairs and between pairs so that we could help set up each other's LED lights. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Reflecting wasn’t used in tius lesson as we worked on a new stage- completely different from the rest. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was constantly engaged as I was always contributing something to our group whether it was packing away, getting things set up or coding!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td>In my learning, I could have taken more time to examine the pictures and remembered to save my work along the way. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td>Next lesson, I will ensure that I save my work along the way and that I examine pictures carefully as they can help supplement the worded instructions provided. </td>
