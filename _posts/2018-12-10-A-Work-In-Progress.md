  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Beginning this lesson, I had successfully completed several pieces of work and saved them. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>This lesson, I aimed to complete one activity which was slightly longer and more complex than the rest. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>This week, I did not reach my target as the code on the School Intranet was incorrect and therefore several edits needed to as well as need to be made. </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td>The five main learning techniques at Challoner's- persevering, questioning, independence, reflecting and engagement.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Persevering was a crucial part of the day: the code on the intranet did not work so the lesson turned into another troubleshooting one. I had to try various methods and where possible, use the directories given to me by the Fuze Box. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I used questioning this lesson when I has to question what in my code could be wrong and how I could edit it to become code that worked and performed the actions that I requireds it to. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Independence, although we worked in pairs, was used when we had to work it out for ourselves and not go to Mr. Keen. This helped me to evaluate how I learn and how I can improve next time. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Reflecting was crucial as although our code included no 'PRINT’ actions, we has to think back to previous lessons and see what we used there that could perhaps fix our code. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Engagement was key in today’s lesson as it was very easy to be disheartened after spending 20 minutes on a line of code that didn’t work. Although I became disheartened a few times, I was engaged with the activity and worked on it right until the end. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td>In my learning today, I could have been less disheartened and kept my morale higher throughout the task as when my code didn’t work, I became quite disappointed and slow when working. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td>Next week, I need to remain focused at all times and expect mistakes and rather than become disheartened, figure out what I could do to correct the mistakes and improve my mindset and work as a whole.  </td>
  </tr>
