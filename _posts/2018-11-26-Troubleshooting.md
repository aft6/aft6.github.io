<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I have already managed to code many various different things into the Fuze Box to create parts of space invaders, make a robot arm move and more...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My aim for the lesson was to complete my coding that I was doing from last week on the robot arms. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I did not manage to this week as there were several problems that I faced. These were that many of the robot arms were broken along with the Fuzz Boxes. However, I did turn the lesson into a constructive one by using the opportunity to improve troubleshooting skills</td>
  </tr>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td>The five main learning techniques at Challoner's- persevering, questioning, independence, reflecting and engagement.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Persevering was undoubtedly the most used in this lesson as when things kept not working I had to replace them and keep checking various factors until it worked. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Questioning was used continuously throughout the lesson when I had to question myself as to what I could have done wrong and why my Fuze Boxes and Robot Arms werenâ€™t working. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Same as previous weeks, I was working with a pair and therefore I used this to our advantage, allowing us to do more together. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Reflecting was used in the lesson when I had to think about what had gone in previous lessons and how I could solve the problem. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Engagement was used when I had to test out all of the new robot arms that I used. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td>I could have been quicker when setting up the Fuze Boxes and been more independent rather than asking Mr. Keen all the time. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td>Next lesson, I need to be quicker when doing things that I know how to do and be more independent by working things out myself when things don't work out as expected. </td>
  </tr>
