  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Prior to this lesson I had experimented with using the robot arms to make it move by doing simple action such as open it's claw. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>My aim for the lesson was to complete the booklet as it concludes on the section to do with the arms.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I did not manage to as there were no working batteries in any of the arms, meaning that our group could not do this. Instead we had to start on a task on the school Intranet.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td>The five main learning techniques at Challoner's- persevering, questioning, independence, reflecting and engagement.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Persevering was key in attempting new code after my code didn’t work the very first time. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Questioning was used in the lesson when we had to ask each other why our code wasn’t working and how we could change it so that a variable would be found. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Independence wasn’t used as we worked together so that we could finish as much as possible despite the early setbacks that we experienced. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Reflecting was used when I had to try and create a new game using Fuze. I had to think of what commands I had used prior to this lesson and how I could apply them to what I was coding. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Engagement was used throughout the lesson when I was either experimenting with code or setting up/ packing away. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td>Throughout my learning, I could have made sure I spelt my variables correctly as many times, when I tried to run my program it told me that there was an 'unassigned variable.’</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td>Next lesson, I need to make sure that I have spelt everything correctly and use capitals when appropriate. </td>
  </tr>
