  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Prior to this lesson I had completed the section 1-3 in the Fuze Book and had started to work on the layout of the LED Fuze Lights part 2.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>I aimed to finish the LED light project and move onto the next section of my project.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I managed to reach my target as I finished the previous section and almost completed the section on Robot Arms, allowing me to learn about how to program the robot to move it's arm and perform simple operations such as switch on a light, lift up it’s claw and to open it’s claw. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td>The five main learning techniques at Challoner's- persevering, questioning, independence, reflecting and engagement.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Persevering was key in today’s lesson and I used to throughout, particularly when I was on the Fuze LED Light Stage as the picture that the Fuze manual demonstrated did not align with ours. Trying a combination of sensible options took time and therefore we had to use a lot of perseverance.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Questioning was used in the second half of the lesson. When our Robot Arm wouldn’t work, we had to question how we could make it work and why it refused to move.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Independence wasn't used in the lesson as we collaborated in pairs and between pairs so that we could help set up each others’ robot arms and LED lights.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Reflecting was used in this lesson when I was required to think back to what I had done last lesson and how I could apply that knowledge to what KI was going to do today. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Engagement! Possibly the most key part of the lesson! Engagement was most important as throughout the lesson, I had to be engaged so that I knew I hadn’t missed a bracket or a semicolon etc.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td>Throughout my learning, I could have read the instructions more thoroughly as many times when I became stuck, it was because I hadn’t read the instructions properly. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td>When I do the next lesson, I will ensure that I read all of the instructions and any tips so that I don’t waste time being stuck on problems that are actually easy once I read. </td>
  </tr>
