I am the former King of England. I have a strong passion for fighting in crusades and pay homage to William I who founded our great kingdom. My power is limited by the Church however, I enjoy their monastic Gregorian Chants. I live in England however, I often visit Rouen in France. Intrestering Fact: I hate Caladonians and I am also the Duke of Normandy.

### More Information

You should fear me as I am decsended from the great Viking Rollo. This makes me the king of Sweden, Norway, Italy and the Republic of Sicily also. I am the Grand Duke of Antioch as well. The prince of Bayeux is only another title I have and I am influential in much of medieval France and Catholic Europe.
